In other words concurrently is now a recommended way to run Vovk and Next.js development servers together. This reduces potential problems with built-in command runner in Vovk.ts but also reduces very relevant confusion for new users.\nWithout Concurrently:\nBefore: vovk dev\nAfter: vovk dev --next-dev - not recommended but can be useful if it works on your machine :)\nWith Concurrently:\nBefore: PORT=3000 concurrently \"vovk dev --no-next-dev\" \"next dev\" --kill-others\nAfter: PORT=3000 concurrently \"vovk dev\" \"next dev\" --kill-others - this is the new recommended way to run Vovk and Next.js development servers together.\n✅ Renamed worker.use to worker.employ to make it less confusing in React components.","minior-changes#Minior changes":"onError option of initVovk now gets request object as the second argument.

Back-End Service is a static class that serves as a library that performs database and third-party API calls outside of Controller Classes.Let's say you have the following Controller Class:\nimport { prefix, put, type VovkRequest } from 'vovk';\nimport type { User } from '../../types';\n@prefix('users')\nexport default class UserController {\n    @put(':id') \n    static async updateUser(req: VovkRequest<Partial<User>>, { id }: { id: string }) {\n        const data = await req.json();\n        const updatedUser = await prisma.user.update({\n            where: { id },\n            data,\n        });\n        return updatedUser;\n    }\n}\nCurrently it looks fine since it doesn't contain a lot of logic. But as your app is getting more complex you're going to get more endpoints with more code. At this case it's recommended to move part of the logic to Back-End Service Class making controllers to be responsible for input extraction, validation and authorisation, but not for DB or API calls.Let's refactor the code above by introducing UserService. For this example it's going to be small but I hope that illustrates the idea clearly.\n// ... import types and libraries ...\nexport default class UserService {\n    static updateUser(id: string, data: Partial<User>) {\n        return prisma.user.update({\n            where: { id },\n            data,\n        });\n    }\n}\nAs you can see, UserService does not use decorators and used as a library that performs required side-effects.\nimport { prefix, put, type VovkRequest } from 'vovk';\nimport UserService from './UserService'\n@prefix('users')\nexport default class UserController {\n    @put(':id') \n    static async updateUser(req: VovkRequest<Partial<User>>, { id }: { id: string }) {\n        const data = await req.json();\n        return UserService.updateUser(id, data);\n    }\n}\nBack-End Service Classes can use other Back-End Services (as well as so-called Isomorphic Service Classes explained in separate article of this documentation).\nimport PostService from '../post/PostService';\nimport CommentService from '../comment/CommentService';\n// ... other imports ...\nexport default class UserService {\n    static async updateUser(id: string, data: Partial<User>) {\n        const latestPost = PostService.findLatestUserPost(id);\n        const latestPostComments = CommentService.findPostComments(latestPost.id);\n        // ...\n    }\n}","hello-world-service-live-example#\"Hello World\" Service Live Example":"Source code"}},"/controller/return":{"title":"Return Type","data":{"custom-object#Custom Object":"The decorated static methods of controllers can return several kinds of objects.

Learn more about REST here.\nRPC: Remote Procedure Call, an approach that allows a client application to invoke server-side functions. Find out more about RPC on Wikipedia.\nWPC: Worker Procedure Call, an approach that enables a front-end application to call functions running in a Web Worker. First introduced in Vovk.ts.

JavaScript/TypeScript does not have a built-in static keyword for classes, but it is a common pattern in other languages like Java and C#. Instead, TypeScript uses the static keyword to define static methods and properties on a regular class.\nDisposable Object: An object that is used once and then discarded. In TypeScript, a disposable object is created with using or await using (instead of let or const) and is automatically disposed of after the code block has ended by calling a method under Symbol.dispose or Symbol.asyncDispose key.\nFor more information, see TypeScript 5.2 Documentation.\nAsync Generator: A function that returns an AsyncIterable object.\nAsync Iterable: An object that can be used in a for await...of loop.

To fix the body and query types Vovk.ts provides a new type VovkRequest<BODY?, QUERY?> that is extended from NextRequest where the first generic argument represents the type of value returned from req.json but also allows to define values returned from req.nextUrl.searchParams.get. VovkRequest also plays crucial role in type inference when vovk-client is used in order to infer types properly.As its mentioned before, req object is an original NextRequest object that provided by Next.js as is, without changing it, but other libraries (like vovk-zod) as well as your custom code can modify this object when needed (for example to add currentUser property defined by your auth guard decorator).To add the required body and query types just replace NextRequest by VovkRequest.

Vovk.ts applies the same principle that is used at controllers and builds main-thread client-side library using the auto-generated .vovk.json. It uses built-in browser API aush as addEventListener and postMessage and does not utilise eval function or Function constructor.WPC Class is created from an Isomorphic Service Class by applying @worker() class decorator that defines onmessage handler in the Web Worker scope.\nQuick explanation: Isomorphic Service Class is a static class that provides code that is shared between front-end and back-end.

You can import the class safely in other modules, including back-end code where it's going to be behave as a normal collection of pure functions.To compile the worker interface, you need to pass them to initVovk as workers object option and export the type of this object as Workers.\nimport { initVovk } from 'vovk';\nimport HelloController from '../../../hello/HelloController';\nimport HelloWorker from '../../../hello/HelloWorker';\nimport ByeWorker from '../../../bye/ByeWorker';\nconst controllers = { HelloController };\nconst workers = { HelloWorker, ByeWorker };\nexport type Controllers = typeof controllers;\nexport type Workers = typeof workers;\nexport const { GET, POST, PUT, DELETE } = initVovk({ controllers, workers });\nOnce this is done, vovk-client is going to export the worker library that provides interface to invoke heavy calculations but doesn't initialise the Web Worker itself. To initialise the Web Worker at the main-thread interface it needs to be instantiated normally and passed as an argument of employ static method.\nimport { HelloWorker } from 'vovk-client';\nHelloWorker.employ(new Worker(new URL('./path/to/HelloWorker.ts', import.meta.url)));\nThis bulky syntax is required to invoke the Webpack 5+ loader used by Next.js internally.
