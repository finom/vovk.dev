# redirect and notFound

To perform a redirect or render the not-found file, you can use the built-in Next.js functions imported from **next/navigation**.

```ts
import { redirect, notFound } from 'next/navigation';

export default class UserController {
  @get('redirect')
  static async redirect() {
    // ... if something
    redirect('/some-other-endpoint');
  }

  @get('not-found')
  static async notFound() {
    // ... if something
    notFound();
  }
}
```

Both functions work by throwing an error, so you don't need to use a `return` statement. TypeScript casts their return type as `never`.

See the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/redirecting) for more information.
