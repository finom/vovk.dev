# Errors

You can gracefully throw HTTP exceptions with the syntax inspired by NestJS. `HttpException` class accepts 3 arguments. The first one is an HTTP code that can be retrieved from `HttpStatus`, the second one is a message, and the third one is an optional `cause` that can be any object that is going to be JSON-stringified and passed down to the client.

```ts
import { HttpException, HttpStatus } from 'vovk';

// ...
static async updateUser(/* ... */) {
    // ...
    throw new HttpException(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, 'Something went wrong');
}
```

The errors are re-thrown at the client library with the same interface.

```ts
import { UserRPC } from 'vovk-client';
import { HttpException } from 'vovk';

// ...
try {
  const updatedUser = await UserController.updateUser(/* ... */);
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e instanceof HttpException); // true
  const err = e as HttpException;
  console.log(err.message, err.statusCode);
}
```

Regular errors such as `Error` are equivalent to `HttpException` with code `500`.

```ts
import { HttpException, HttpStatus } from 'vovk';

// ...
static async updateUser(/* ... */) {
    // ...
    throw new Error('Something went wrong'); // 500
}
```

You can throw custom objects that are going to be re-thrown on the client-side as is.

```ts
throw { hello: 'World' };
```

You can provide `cause` to the `HttpException` constructor as 3rd argument to provide more context to the error.

```ts
throw new HttpException(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, 'Something went wrong', { hello: 'World' });
```

## HttpStatus enum

There are the values of the `HttpStatus` enum for quick reference.

```ts
export enum HttpStatus {
  NULL = 0, // for client-side errors, such as client-side validation
  CONTINUE = 100,
  SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS = 101,
  PROCESSING = 102,
  EARLYHINTS = 103,
  OK = 200,
  CREATED = 201,
  ACCEPTED = 202,
  NON_AUTHORITATIVE_INFORMATION = 203,
  NO_CONTENT = 204,
  RESET_CONTENT = 205,
  PARTIAL_CONTENT = 206,
  AMBIGUOUS = 300,
  MOVED_PERMANENTLY = 301,
  FOUND = 302,
  SEE_OTHER = 303,
  NOT_MODIFIED = 304,
  TEMPORARY_REDIRECT = 307,
  PERMANENT_REDIRECT = 308,
  BAD_REQUEST = 400,
  UNAUTHORIZED = 401,
  PAYMENT_REQUIRED = 402,
  FORBIDDEN = 403,
  NOT_FOUND = 404,
  METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED = 405,
  NOT_ACCEPTABLE = 406,
  PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED = 407,
  REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 408,
  CONFLICT = 409,
  GONE = 410,
  LENGTH_REQUIRED = 411,
  PRECONDITION_FAILED = 412,
  PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE = 413,
  URI_TOO_LONG = 414,
  UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE = 415,
  REQUESTED_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE = 416,
  EXPECTATION_FAILED = 417,
  I_AM_A_TEAPOT = 418,
  MISDIRECTED = 421,
  UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY = 422,
  FAILED_DEPENDENCY = 424,
  PRECONDITION_REQUIRED = 428,
  TOO_MANY_REQUESTS = 429,
  INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR = 500,
  NOT_IMPLEMENTED = 501,
  BAD_GATEWAY = 502,
  SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE = 503,
  GATEWAY_TIMEOUT = 504,
  HTTP_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED = 505,
}
```
