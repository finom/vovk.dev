# Deploying to Vercel

You can use any hosting provider that supports Node.js applications, but for the sake of simplicity, we're going to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as it would take minimal effort to deploy the app for a quick demo. We're going to need to set up two integrations for Vercel: [Neon](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon) for Postgres/PGVector database hosting and [Redis](https://vercel.com/integrations/redis) for Redis hosting. The first one is going to be used as the main database, while the second one is going to be used as a database event bus for real-time features that will be described in the [Polling](./polling) article, but also as a temporary storage for messages consumed by the demo [Telegram bot](./telegram).

**Note:** Vovk.ts is not affiliated with Vercel, Telegram or Neon in any way.

In order to deploy the app, with the same setup, create a new project at Vercel, link it to the fork of the GitHub repository, and add the above mentioned integrations, available in free plan.

Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` at the project environment variables. Other variables such as `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` are going to be created automatically by the integrations. 

It's also recommended to add `PASSWORD` variable in order to enable simple (and free) password protection for the app. You can set it to any desired value.

For MCP protection, you can also add `MCP_ACCESS_KEY` variable in order to enable simple authorization for MCP server using `?mcp_access_key=your_key` query param. If this variable is not set, no authorization is required.

Finally, for Telegram bot integration, you can add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` variable if you want to use Telegram bot feature. See the [Telegram integration](./telegram) article for more details.

In case of a problem, check the [.env.template](https://github.com/finom/realtime-kanban/blob/main/.env.template) file for reference.
