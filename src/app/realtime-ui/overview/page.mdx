# Realtime UI Overview

This series walks through **Realtime Kanban**, a full‑stack reference app that demonstrates a **Realtime UI** architecture. The app behaves like a standard web application, but it’s also designed to be operated by **AI agents** via text or voice, and by **MCP clients**—including navigation and workflow automation—while keeping both front‑end and back‑end code short and easy to follow.

Key building blocks:

- **Entity-driven state normalization (front end)** with [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand): back-end responses are parsed through an entity registry that updates a normalized store, so components can read entities by ID and re-render with minimal wiring.
- **Database schema as the source of truth**: Postgres + Prisma define structure and drive Zod schemas via [prisma-zod-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma-zod-generator). The same schemas validate back-end procedure inputs to keep the codebase DRY.
- **Database polling events** via Redis, exposed as [JSON Lines](/jsonlines) streaming endpoints: changes from users, MCP clients, or bots propagate to the UI without manual refreshes.
- **Text-based AI chat** using the Vercel [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction) and [AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements): existing controllers are reused to define AI tools, and results flow back through the entity registry pipeline.
- **Voice interface** with the [OpenAI Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) + WebRTC: the agent performs authorized HTTP requests through generated RPC modules; responses update the UI through the same entity registry flow. The example also includes client-side tools for in-app navigation.
- **MCP server**: procedures run locally on the back end and trigger polling events, updating front-end state through the entity registry.
- **External updates** (Telegram bot): manage tasks through text/voice inside Telegram, showing how the same app can be controlled from multiple surfaces.

You can [run the app locally](./run) with Docker Compose or deploy it to any Node.js platform (for example, [Vercel](./deploy)).
