# Composed Client Mode

By default, Vovk.ts generates a single RPC client that aggregates all RPC modules from every segment. This approach—called the **Composed Client**—is useful for single-page applications where you want a single import entry point for all RPC modules across all segments. The files are emitted to the [reconfigurable](/config) **node_modules/.vovk-client** folder and are re-exported by the **vovk-client** package.

The structure of the **node_modules/.vovk-client** folder generated by the default [js](/templates#js) template looks like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="node_modules/.vovk-client" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.js" />
    <FileTree.File name="index.d.ts" />
    <FileTree.File name="schema.js" />
    <FileTree.File name="schema.d.ts" />
    <FileTree.File name="openapi.json" />
    <FileTree.File name="openapi.js" />
    <FileTree.File name="openapi.d.ts" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

The **vovk-client** package re-exports `index.js`, `index.d.ts`, etc., from its own entry points.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="node_modules/vovk-client/index.js"
export * from '../.vovk-client/index.js';
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="node_modules/vovk-client/index.d.ts"
export * from '../.vovk-client/index.d.ts';
```

etc.

The default generation can be reproduced with the [CLI](/generate) command:

```sh npm2yarn copy
npx vovk generate --from js --out-dir node_modules/.vovk-client
```

## Composed Client Config

The composed client can be configured with the following options:

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="vovk.config.mjs"
/** @type {import('vovk').VovkConfig} */
const config = {
  composedClient: {
    enabled: true, // default
    fromTemplates: ['js'], // default
    outDir: './node_modules/.vovk-client', // default
    includeSegments: ['foo'], // mutually exclusive with `excludeSegments`
    excludeSegments: ['bar'], // mutually exclusive with `includeSegments`
  },
};
export default config;
```

### `enabled`

If set to `false`, the composed client will not be generated. Useful when you only want segmented clients.

### `fromTemplates`

An array of templates used to generate the composed client. By default, `["js"]` produce ESM modules with TypeScript definitions. You can mix [built-in templates](/templates) and custom templates.

### `outDir`

The path where the composed client is generated. Defaults to `./node_modules/.vovk-client`. The path is relative to the current working directory (CWD).

### `includeSegments`

An array of segments to include in the composed client. By default, all segments are included. Use this to include only specific segments.

### `excludeSegments`

An array of segments to exclude from the composed client. By default, none are excluded. This option is mutually exclusive with `includeSegments`.

### `prettifyClient`

Whether to format the generated client code. Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the client code is formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) using your local configuration and slightly increases generation time.

### `outputConfig`

Overrides the root [`outputConfig` options](/config#outputconfig).

## Troubleshooting

### vovk-client and pnpm

If you are using `pnpm` as your package manager, you might encounter issues with the **vovk-client** package not being hoisted correctly. This can lead to module resolution errors when importing the client in your application.

To resolve this issue, it's recommended to compile the composed client into a local directory within your project instead of the default `node_modules/.vovk-client` and updating `fromTemplates` to use [`ts`](/templates#ts) template. At this case **vovk-client** package is not needed anymore since the client can be imported directly from the local directory.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="vovk.config.mjs"
/** @type {import('vovk').VovkConfig} */
const config = {
  composedClient: {
    fromTemplates: ['ts'], // overrides the default ['js']
    outDir: './src/client', // a project directory
  },
};

export default config;
```
