# Other Scenarios

## AI Website Builders

The minimalistic design of Vovk.ts allows you to easily create complex back-end logic using AI generators, involving minimal input context and making AI agents think less, minimizing hallucinations and improving the reliability of the generated RESTful APIs.

Compared to NestJS, Vovk.ts requires fewer imports, fewer decorators, doesn't require connecting controllers and services into a "module", doesn't use dependency injection ([services](/controller/service) are just namespaced functions with no decorators), supports inline input/output models (so AI doesn't need to create "DTO" classes in a separate file), and supports basically any modern [validation library](/validation), etc.

With modern tooling such as [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/), even small LLM models would be capable of understanding the task and generating working, complex code.

Here are the features of Vovk.ts that make it suitable for AI-generated back-ends:

- Almost zero boilerplate, just a [config](/config) file.
- The most minimalistic syntax for defining API routes for a back-end framework with OAS support.
- Requires a single Next.js project, so AI wouldn't struggle with a monorepo.
- Clear syntax for RPC modules that can be used on the front-end side.
- Clear type inference for input/output models, see [the inference documentation](/inference).

Bonus points available out of the box:

- [Multitenancy](/multitenant) support with Next.js Middleware.
- [OpenAPI documentation](/openapi) with code samples.
- [Function calling framework](/function-calling) that turns controllers (for server-side tools) and RPC modules (for client-side tools) into powerful agents, including [MCP servers](/mcp).
- [OpenAPI mixins](/codegen) that allow you to integrate third-party APIs into the AI-generated project.
- [Bundling](/bundle) feature that allows you to create and publish RPC libraries with minimal effort.

## Using Next.js + Vovk.ts as a Standalone RESTful API Server

Next.js is known as a React framework, offering UI/UX-related features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, partial pre-rendering, etc. Due to the specifics and limitations of `route.ts` files, it can't be called a full-featured back-end framework, providing an extended but limited alternative to simple back-end libraries such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), or [Koa](https://koajs.com/).

However, just as NestJS is built on top of Express, Vovk.ts is built on top of Next.js API routes, turning it into a full-featured back-end framework with Controller-Service-Repository architecture, OpenAPI documentation, as well as code generation, RPC support, and more.

This allows you to use Next.js + Vovk.ts as a standalone RESTful API server without utilizing React-related features. Just set `rootEntry` to `''` in the [config](/config) file (by default, it's set to `'api'`) and create your API routes in the root of the `./src/app` folder.

-----

Let's say you have an Angular, Vue.js, or other front-end project that requires a RESTful API server. You can use a monorepo with two projects: one for the front-end powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and another for the back-end powered by Next.js and Vovk.ts, which can emit RPC modules directly to the front-end project (by setting the `outDir` [config](/config) option to `../front-end/node_modules/.vovk-client` for the [composed](/composed) client or `../front-end/src/client` for the [segmented](/segmented) client).

-----

If you want to use Next.js + Vovk.ts as a standalone RESTful API server but don't want to set up a monorepo, you can split the front-end and back-end into two separate repositories, where the back-end repository [bundles](/bundle) the client library and publishes it as a private NPM package that can be installed in the front-end part.
