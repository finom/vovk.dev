# Other Scenarios

## AI Website Builders

The minimalistic design of Vovk.ts makes it easy to create complex back-end logic with AI generators, requiring minimal input context and reducing cognitive load for AI agents. This helps minimize hallucinations and improves the reliability of generated RESTful APIs.

Compared to NestJS, Vovk.ts requires fewer imports and decorators, does not require wiring controllers and services into a “module”, does not use dependency injection ([services](/controller/service) are just namespaced functions with no decorators), supports inline input/output models (so AI does not need to create “DTO” classes in separate files), and works with virtually any modern [validation library](/validation).

With modern tooling such as [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/), even small LLMs can reliably generate high-quality, functional code.

Here are the features of Vovk.ts that make it suitable for AI-generated back ends:

- Almost zero boilerplate—just a [config](/config) file.
- The most minimal syntax for defining API routes among back-end frameworks with OAS support.
- A single Next.js project, so AI does not struggle with a monorepo.
- Clear syntax for RPC modules that can be used on the front end.
- Clear type inference for input/output models; see the [inference documentation](/inference).

Bonus capabilities available out of the box:

- [Multitenancy](/multitenant) with Next.js Middleware.
- [OpenAPI documentation](/openapi) with code samples.
- A [function calling framework](/function-calling) that turns controllers (server-side tools) and RPC modules (client-side tools) into powerful agents, including [MCP servers](/mcp).
- [OpenAPI Mixins](/codegen) to integrate third-party APIs into an AI-generated project.
- [Bundling](/bundle) to create and publish RPC libraries with minimal effort.

## Using Next.js + Vovk.ts as a Standalone RESTful API Server

Next.js is known as a React framework with UI/UX features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and partial pre-rendering. Due to the nature and limitations of `route.ts` files, it is not a full-featured back-end framework out of the box. It provides an extended but constrained alternative to simpler back-end libraries such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), or [Koa](https://koajs.com/).

However, just as NestJS builds on Express, Vovk.ts builds on Next.js API routes, turning them into a full-featured back-end framework with a Controller–Service–Repository architecture, OpenAPI documentation, code generation, RPC support, and more.

This lets you use Next.js + Vovk.ts as a standalone RESTful API server without React-related features. Set `rootEntry` to `''` in the [config](/config) (it defaults to `'api'`), and create your API routes in the root of `./src/app`.

-----

If you have an Angular, Vue.js, or other front-end project that needs a RESTful API server, you can use a monorepo with two projects: one front end powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and one back end powered by Next.js and Vovk.ts. The back end can emit RPC modules directly to the front-end project (by setting the `outDir` [config](/config) option to `../front-end/node_modules/.vovk-client` for the [composed](/composed) client or `../front-end/src/client` for the [segmented](/segmented) client).

-----

If you prefer not to use a monorepo, you can split the front end and back end into separate repositories. The back end can [bundle](/bundle) the client library and publish it as a private NPM package that the front end consumes.
