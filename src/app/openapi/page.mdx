# Framework for public REST API

Vovk.ts automatically generates OpenAPI specification from the defined controllers and methods. The generated client exports `openapi` object for [composed client](/composed) and for each chunk of [segmented client](/segmented) separately.

```ts
import { UserRPC, openapi } from 'vovk-client'; // composed client
```

```ts
import { UserRPC, openapi } from '@/client/user/index.ts'; // segmented client
```

The `openapi` object can also be imported from `vovk-client/openapi` or `@client/user/openapi` that import the object only, without the RPC client.

The object is a ready-to-use OpenAPI specification that can be used with any tool that supports OpenAPI 3+.

You can create a [static segment](/segment/static) with a simple controller that exposes the spec as a JSON file.

```sh npm2yarn
npx vovk new segment --static static
```

```sh npm2yarn
npx vovk new controller static/openApi --empty
```

The object can be used directly or exposed as an endpoint:

```ts filename="src/modules/static/openapi/OpenApiController.ts"
import { get, operation } from "vovk";
import { openapi } from "vovk-client/openapi";

export default class OpenApiController {
  @operation({ // the operation object definition is optional
    summary: "OpenAPI spec",
    description: 'Get the OpenAPI spec for the API',
  })
  @get("openapi.json")
  static getSpec = () => openapi;
}
```

On the client-side you can use any OpenAPI tooling, but it's recommended to [Scalar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scalar/api-reference-react) as Vovk.ts generates code snippets:

```tsx
import { ApiReferenceReact } from "@scalar/api-reference-react";
import "@scalar/api-reference-react/style.css";

async function App() {
  return (
    <ApiReferenceReact
      configuration={{
        url: "/api/static/openapi.json",
        servers: [
          {
            url: "http://localhost:3000",
            description: "Localhost",
          },
          {
            url: "https://example.com",
            description: "Production",
          },
        ],
      }}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```
