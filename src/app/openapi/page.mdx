# Framework for public REST API

Vovk.ts automatically generates OpenAPI specification from the defined controllers and methods. The generated client exports `openapi` object for [composed client](/composed) and for each chunk of [segmented client](/segmented) separately.

```ts
import { UserRPC, openapi } from 'vovk-client'; // composed client
```

```ts
import { UserRPC, openapi } from '@/client/user/index.ts'; // segmented client
```

It's a ready-to-use OpenAPI specification that can be used with any tool that supports OpenAPI 3+.
