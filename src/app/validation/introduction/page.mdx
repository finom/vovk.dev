# Getting started

Vovk.ts as a back-end framework supports a wide range of validation libraries, including [Standard Schema](/validation/standard). The validation models are emitted as JSON Schemas in order to be used for validation on the client side (but also for code generation, [OpenAPI spec](/openapi) and [LLM Tools](/function-calling), etc). The server-side and the client-side validation are two different features, the second one is outlined in [the client validation page](/validation/client). This page will explain how to use the validation in the server-side code.

Every validation library uses an internal `withValidationLibrary` function that is used to wrap the controller handler, providing unified list of options and extending the handler with extra features. Each library is named as `with[name]` where the `name` is the name of the library, e.g. [`withZod`](/validation/zod).

## Options

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { withZod } from 'vovk-zod';
import { prefix, post } from 'vovk';

@prefix('users')
export default class UserController {
  @post('{id}')
  static updateUser = withZod({
    body: z.object({ /* ...*/ })
    params: z.object({ /* ...*/ }),
    query: z.object({ /* ...*/ }),
    output: z.object({ /* ...*/ }), // in case of JSON response
    // iteration: z.object({ /* ...*/ }), // in case of JSONLines response
    // validateEachIteration: true, // for JSONLines response only
    disableServerSideValidation: ['body', 'query'], // disable server-side validation for body and query
    skipSchemaEmission: ['output'], // skip schema emission for output
    isForm: false, // default
    async handle(req, params) {
      // ...
    },
  });
}
```

### `body`, `query` and `params`

The `body`, `query` and `params` options are used to specify input validation schemas. These schemas are used to validate the incoming request data before it reaches the controller handler.

### `output` and `iteration`

The `output` and `iteration` options are used to specify the output validation schemas, where `output` is used for regular JSON responses and `iteration` is used for [JSONLines](/controller/jsonlines) responses. Both are optional and they don't affect the generated RPC modules typing, but recommended for enabling crutial features such as [OpenAPI spec](/openapi) generation, [Function Calling](/function-calling) and [Codegen](/codegen) for [Python](/python), [Rust](/rust) and other further clients. The `output` and `iteration` aren't used for the client-side validation.

### `isForm`

The `isForm` option is used to specify whether the request body is a form data. This is useful for handling file uploads and other form-related data. Setting it to `true` also changes the RPC module typing to accept `FormData` on the client side as `body` option.

### `handle`

The `handle` is the controller handler function that will be executed after the validation is successful. It is the main function that processes the request and returns a response. It provides a type-flavoured `NextRequest`, represented as [`VovkRequest<TBody, TQuery, TParams>`](/controller/request) type as the first argument, and `params` value as the second argument.

### `disableServerSideValidation`

The `disableServerSideValidation` option is used to disable the server-side validation for the specified validation library. It can be a boolean value that indicates whether to disable validation on the server-side completely, or an array of validation types (`body`, `query`, `params`, `output`, `iteration`). This is useful when you want to skip the server-side validation for certain requests. This option does not affect type inference in the generated RPC modules.

### `skipSchemaEmission`

The `skipSchemaEmission` option is used to skip the emission of the JSON Schemas for the handler, allowing to hide implementation details from the client-side code. It can be a boolean value that disables schema emission completely, or an array of validation types to skip schema emission for specific validation types (`body`, `query`, `params`, `output`, `iteration`). This option does not affect type inference in the generated RPC modules.

### `validateEachIteration`

The `validateEachIteration` option is used exclusively for the `iteration` validation schema. It indicates whether to validate each item in the iteration response, where by default it validates only the first iteration item.

### `operation`

An optional `operation` object can be provided to specify OAS operation details for the method when `@operation` decorator is not aplicable. Might be useful when using [`fn`](/controller/fn) on a normal function, not a class method.

## Features

A handler created with `withValidationLibrary` function gets some extra features that enhance its capabilities.

### `fn`

The `fn` property alllows to call the handler function directly, at the current context, without making an HTTP request. It follows similar signature as the generated RPC handler and accepts the same parameters.

```ts
const result = await UserController.updateUser.fn({
    body: { /* ... */ },
    query: { /* ... */ },
    params: { /* ... */ },
    meta: { /* ... */ },
    disableClientSideValidation: false, // default
});

// same as
const result = await UserRPC.updateUser({
    body: { /* ... */ },
    query: { /* ... */ },
    params: { /* ... */ },
    meta: { /* ... */ },
    disableClientSideValidation: false, // default
});
```

For more information about the `fn` property, see [the callable handlers page](/controller/fn). Also see the [meta documentation](/controller/meta), since it's handled differently in the `fn` property and the RPC module.

### `schema`

```ts
const schema = UserController.updateUser.schema;

// same as UserRPC.updateUser.schema
```

The `schema` property provides the method schema for the handler, similar to the RPC method schema. It's used in tendem with the `fn` property to build [Function Calling tools](/function-calling) to call the handler directly from the AI tools, without making an HTTP request.

### `models`

```ts
const bodyModel = UserController.updateUser.models.body;
```

The `models` property is exclusive to the server-side methods. It allows to access the original validation models used in the handler.
