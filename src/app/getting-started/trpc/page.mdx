# Comparison with tRPC TODO
{/* To do: Also compare with https://blitzjs.com/ */}
With all due respect to everyone who contributed to [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), it was one of the key projects (alongside [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)) that inspired me while building Vovk.ts. Given this, I believe it's fair to draw comparisons between them.

Since tRPC can be considered as a standalone back-end framework because of multiple [adapters](https://trpc.io/docs/server/adapters), and Vovk.ts works only under Next.js, it's fair to compare them in the context of **back-end for Next.js**.
