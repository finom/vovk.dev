-----

The `init` command initializes Vovk.ts in an existing Next.js project. It sets up the necessary configurations and installs the required dependencies to get started with Vovk.ts.

You can also use an alias for the `init` command, which is available as a [separate package](/packages#vovk-init).

```sh npm2yarn
npx vovk-init@draft
```

This is equivalent to:

```sh npm2yarn
npx vovk-cli@draft init
```

## Available Flags

### `--prefix <prefix>`
Specifies the directory to initialize the project in. If not provided, the current directory is used.

### `-y, --yes`
Skips all prompts and uses default values.

### `--log-level <level>`
Sets the log level. Available levels are: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`. By default, it's set to `info`.

### `--use-npm`, `--use-yarn`, `--use-pnpm`, `--use-bun`
Specifies the package manager to use when installing dependencies.

### `--skip-install`
Skips the installation of dependencies but still modifies the `package.json` file.

### `--update-ts-config`
Updates the `tsconfig.json` file to include necessary configurations for Vovk.ts, such as enabling `experimentalDecorators`.

### `--update-scripts <mode>`
Updates the `package.json` scripts to include the `dev` script that runs both the Next.js server and Vovk.ts concurrently. The mode can be either "implicit" or "explicit", where "implicit" runs the concurrent API under the hood, and "explicit" uses `concurrently` as a CLI. The flag also sets the `prebuild` script to run `vovk generate` before `next build` to ensure the client library is generated before building the Next.js app.

### `--lang <languages...>`
Generates the client for other programming languages. Sets [`composedClient.templates`](/composed#templates) to include "py" for Python and "rs" for Rust.

### `--validation-library <library>`
Specifies the validation library to use. Supported options are "zod", "class-validator", "valibot", "arktype", or "none" to skip validation. For some libraries that support [Standard Schema](/validation/standard) like "arktype", it also creates a validation library located at **./src/lib/**, for example **./src/lib/withArk.ts**.

If the validation library isn't set to "none", the command updates the [config](/config) file to include `validateOnClient` that corresponds to the chosen validation library.

### `--channel <channel>`
Specifies the channel to use for fetching packages (default: "latest"). You can use "draft" or "beta" to get the latest features. In this case, you need to use the `@draft` or `@beta` suffix when running the command:

```sh npm2yarn
npx vovk-init@beta --channel beta
```

### `--dry-run`
Does not write files to disk but shows what would be done.

### `-h, --help`
Displays help for the command.
