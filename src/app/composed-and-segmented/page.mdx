# Isolated client

You can generate RPC libraries for every individual segment. This would allow you to import RPC modules that use specific segments of the schema and to protect schema for other segments to be available for inspection in a resulting JS bundle of an app area.

At this case the client code should be generated at the project level, instead of **node_modules/.vovk-client** folder and you don't need to use **vovk-client** package in your project.

To achieve that you need to update the [config](/config) file with the following options:

- `generateSegmentClient` - should be set to `true` to enable isolated client generation.
- `generateFrom` - should be set to `['ts']` to generate **.ts** files instead of **.mjs** and **.cjs**.
- `clientOutDir` - should be set to the path where you want to generate the client code. By default, it uses `node_modules/.vovk-client` folder.
- `generateFullClient` - can be optionally set to `false` to disable full client generation.
- `prettifyClient` - optionally set to `true` to prettify the generated client code. By default, it's `false`.

```ts filename="vovk.config.mjs"
/** @type {import('vovk-cli').VovkConfig} */
const config = {
  generateSegmentClient: true,
  generateFrom: ['ts'],
  clientOutDir: './src/client',
  generateFullClient: false,
  prettifyClient: true,
};
export default config;
```

The config above will generate the client code in the **./src/client** folder. Each segment will have its own folder with the generated client code. For example, client for the root segment will be generated in the **./src/client/root** folder, client for the segment `admin` will be generated in the **./src/client/admin** folder, client for the segment `foo/bar/baz` will be generated in the **./src/client/foo/bar/baz** folder, etc.

You can optionally update **tsconfig.json** in order to define the path to the generated client code. This will allow you to import the client code from the generated folder without using relative paths.

```json filename="tsconfig.json" {4}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/client/*": ["./src/client/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

After that you can import the RPCs the following way:

```ts
import { ProductRPC } from '@/client/root';
import { UserRPC } from '@/client/admin';
import { CheckoutRPC } from '@/client/customer';

// ...
```

If `generateFullClient` is not set to `false`, the RPCs are going to be available at the root of the **./src/client** folder.

```ts
import { ProductRPC, UserRPC, CheckoutRPC } from '@/client';

// ...
```
