# Framework for SaaS Applications

Next.js, combined with Vovk.ts, provides a powerful foundation for building SaaS applications that are easy to deploy, scale, and maintain. It includes a rich set of out-of-the-box features addressing modern requirements and common SaaS use cases.

## Low-Cost Development and Deployment

The entire app is implemented as a single Next.js application that, when deployed, splits into multiple serverless functions (smaller "back-ends"), each serving a specific purpose. This architecture reduces infrastructure costs while enabling effortless horizontal scaling by adding more functions defined as Next.js `page.tsx` (UI) and `route.ts` (server-side code) files. It also makes repository management significantly easier, as developers don't need to maintain a mono-repository that always requires additional configuration and tooling.

## Enable Multi-Tenancy

A large application often needs to be split into multiple areas, each serving a different purpose and audience. Next.js with Vovk.ts makes it easy to implement multi-tenant SaaS applications that can serve different areas from different domains or subdomains within a single Next.js app (such as [example.com](https://multitenant.vovk.dev/), [admin.example.com](https://admin.multitenant.vovk.dev/), [customer.example.com](https://customer.multitenant.vovk.dev/)), while still being able to share code and resources between them.

## Build JARVIS-Grade Real-Time User Interfaces

Vovk.ts provides a powerful function calling framework that turns controllers and RPC modules into AI-accessible functions that can be executed at the current evaluation context or or via an HTTP request to the server. With simple front-end techniques, you can build real-time user interfaces that update as the AI generates function parameters, providing a seamless and interactive experience for app users with minimal development effort. This approach is especially useful for people with disabilities, as it allows them to interact with the application using voice commands and see the UI respond in real-time.

## Create MCP Servers

Implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers has never been easier. With the function calling framework built into Vovk.ts, you can create MCP servers in no time and with minimal development effort. This allows you to build applications that can seamlessly interact with other AI-powered systems, providing the full range of AI interoperability features developers expect today.

## Offer Public API to Your Customers

Vovk.ts implements the conventional RESTful API, allowing you to expose API endpoints to the public without additional explanation for internal endpoint design. With the help of [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) integration, the OpenAPI operations are enhanced with runnable examples that can be copied and pasted into the project right away.

## Offer Installable Libraries for Your Public API

The client-side RPC library can be packaged and distributed to be installed and used by other developers. This enables other developers to integrate with your API quickly, without needing to write boilerplate networking code.

## Integrate Third-Party APIs

Using third-party APIs has never been easier. The generated RPC library can be mixed with other APIs if they provide an OpenAPI specification document in JSON or YAML format. The generated modules follow the same design as the RPC modules created with the Vovk.ts library, allowing you to use them as part of your function calling or MCP framework.
