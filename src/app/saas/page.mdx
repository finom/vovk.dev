# Framework for SaaS Applications

Next.js in tandem with Vovk.ts offers a framework for building SaaS applications that is easy to deploy, scale, and maintain, while also providing a set of out-of-the-box features that cover common use cases.

<Steps>

## Cheap Development and Deployment

The entire app is implemented as a single Next.js application that, when deployed, splits into multiple serverless functions (smaller "back-ends"), each serving a specific purpose. This makes deployment infrastructure cheaper, as there's only one Next.js app to deploy with minimal configuration, while still being able to scale horizontally by adding more functions defined as Next.js `page.tsx` (UI) and `route.ts` (server-side code) files. It also makes repository management easier, as you don't need to maintain a monorepo that requires additional configuration and tooling.

## Enable Multi-Tenancy

In the most classical case, a SaaS application is split into 3 areas:

1. Root area - serves the landing page with some features like "subscribe to newsletter", stats collection, etc. It's available to all unauthenticated users, serving marketing content, pricing plans, etc.
2. Customer area - serves authenticated customers, providing access to the main features of the application.
3. Admin area - serves authenticated administrators, providing access to admin features such as managing customers, billing, etc.

Each area is served from a separate Next.js `route.ts` file, allowing you to split the application into multiple segments, each served as a separate serverless function (i.e., separate "back-ends"). This allows you to scale the application horizontally by adding more functions while still being able to serve different areas of the application from different domains, such as `https://example.com`, `https://admin.example.com`, `https://customer.example.com`, and so on.

## Enable AI Features

Vovk.ts is designed to cover the most common use cases for AI-powered applications, such as JSON streaming and function calling, allowing you to build AI-powered applications with minimal effort. The most interesting part is that with some front-end tricks, you can achieve real-time UI updates powered by LLMs, making the user experience more interactive and engaging. This also allows people with disabilities to have a better experience by interacting with the application using voice commands.

## Offer Public API to Your Customers

Vovk.ts implements the conventional RESTful API, allowing you to expose API endpoints to the public without additional explanation for internal endpoint design. With the help of [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) integration, the OpenAPI operations are enhanced with runnable examples that can be copied and pasted into the project right away.

## Offer Installable Libraries for Your Public API

The client-side RPC library can be packaged and distributed to be installed and used by other developers, saving your time and money on the development and maintenance of a manually developed library.

## Use Third-Party APIs

Using third-party APIs has never been easier. The generated RPC library can be mixed with other APIs if they provide an OpenAPI specification document in JSON or YAML format. The generated modules follow the same design as the RPC modules created with the Vovk.ts library, allowing you to use them as part of your function calling or MCP framework.
