# CLI

Vovk provides a set of commands to simplify the development process. The commands are available via `vovk` binary that is installed with **vovk-cli** package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install vovk-cli@draft --save-dev
```

- [vovk init](/init) - creates a new Vovk.ts project.
- [vovk dev](/dev) - runs Vovk Dev script that watches for changes at controllers and updates the [schema](/schema) and the client, when needed.
- [vovk generate](/generate) - generates the client based on the [schema](/schema) and [config](/config).
- [vovk new](/new) - module generator that helps to create segments, controllers, services and other modules that you can define as a template at [config](/config).
- [vovk bundle](/bundle) - bundles the TypeScript client library into a single package to be published on NPM. Uses [tsdown](https://tsdown.dev/) API behind the scenes.
