Vovk provides a set of CLI commands to streamline development. The commands are available via the `vovk` binary installed with the **vovk-cli** package.

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm install vovk-cli@draft --save-dev
```

- [vovk init](/init) — creates a new Vovk.ts project.
- [vovk dev](/dev) — runs a dev process that watches controller changes and updates the [schema](/schema) and client as needed.
- [vovk generate](/generate) — generates the client based on the [schema](/schema) and [config](/config).
- [vovk new](/new) — generates segments, controllers, services, and other modules defined via `moduleTemplates` in the [config](/config).
- [vovk bundle](/bundle) — bundles the TypeScript client into a single package for publication to npm, using the [tsdown](https://tsdown.dev/) API or another bundler of your choice.
