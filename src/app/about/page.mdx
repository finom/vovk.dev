# Core Concepts & Features

## Next.js App Router Back-End Framework

Vovk.ts is built on top of the Next.js App Router, utilizing Route Handlers as the underlying HTTP framework and being a thin abstraction layer over it, being fully compatible with existing Next.js features and libraries.

- [Next.js Route Handlers (nextjs.org)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/route-handlers)
- [Procedure](/procedure)

## Schema

Vovk.ts generates a comprehensive back-end schema in JSON format. This polarizing approach makes endpoint definition to be the only source of truth, enabling direct type mapping between back-end and front-end code, doesn't require contract definition, but also can expose custom data defined in a decorator to the client side.

## Code Generation and "RPC Modules"

Controllers implemented as static classes are compiled into RPC modules through code generation. Each RPC module mirrors the controller's structure but has a different argument signature, requiring three separate inputs: URL parameters, query parameters, and request body. The code generation can be configured to emit either a single "composed" RPC client or multiple "segmented" RPC clients for each back-end segment independently.

## Deriving AI Tools

Vovk.ts can derive AI tools from back-end controllers (for same-context execution) and RPC modules (for HTTP calls), turning them into LLM function calling tools with `name`, `description`, `parameters`, and an `execute` function. This allows you to create AI agents that can interact with your back-end functionality seamlessly.

## Controller-Service-Repository Pattern

Vovk.ts encourages the use of the Controller-Service-Repository pattern for organizing back-end code. Controllers handle HTTP requests and services contain business logic. This separation of concerns leads to cleaner, more maintainable code for large applications.

## Back-end Segmentation

Vovk.ts utilizes Next.js routing capabilities to introduce an additional hierarchy level in the back-end called [segments](/segment). Segments allow you to split the back-end into smaller, independently configured parts, each compiled into a separate serverless function.

- [Segment](/segment)

## OpenAPI Mixins

Vovk.ts can convert OpenAPI 3.x schema files into API modules following that follow the same calling signature as Vovk.ts RPC modules. This allows you to mix Vovk.ts back-end functionality with third-party APIs defined in OpenAPI format and create derived AI tools that combine both - your back-end and external services.

- [OpenAPI Mixins](/codegen)

## Documentation Generation and Publishing

Vovk.ts generates comprehensive documentation for RPC modules, including OpenAPI 3.1 documentation with code examples, compatible with [Scalar](https://scalar.com/), but also includes codegen templates for README and package files. This allows you to publish client libraries for TypeScript (using easily configured bundler), Python, and Rust with minimal effort.
