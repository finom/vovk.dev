# Core Concepts & Features

## Next.js App Router Back-End Framework

Vovk.ts is built on top of the Next.js App Router, utilizing Route Handlers as the underlying HTTP framework and being a thin abstraction layer over it, being fully compatible with existing Next.js features and libraries. It encourages the use of the Controller-Service-Repository pattern for organizing back-end code, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code for large applications.

- [Procedure](/procedure)

## Back-end Segmentation

Vovk.ts utilizes Next.js routing capabilities to introduce an additional hierarchy level in the back-end called [segments](/segment), powered by Next.js Route Handlers. Segments allow you to split the back-end into smaller, independently configured parts, each compiled into a separate serverless function.

- [Segment](/segment)

## Schema Emission

Vovk.ts generates a comprehensive back-end schema in JSON format for each segment separately. This polarizing approach, usually opposed to contracts (schema implemented in a separate module that's read by back-end and front-end), makes endpoint definition to be the only source of truth, enabling direct type mapping between back-end and front-end code (with CMD+Click you can navigate from the RPC method to the controller method), but also can expose custom data set by a decorator to the client side. Each segment emits its schema to an individual JSON file, located in **.vovk-schema/** folder.

## Code Generation and "RPC Modules"

Controllers implemented as static classes are compiled into RPC modules through code generation. Each RPC module mirrors the controller's structure but has a different argument signature, requiring three separate inputs: URL parameters, query parameters, and request body. The code generation can be configured to emit either a single "composed" RPC client or multiple "segmented" RPC clients for each back-end segment independently, splitting the app into isolated parts that use their own schema files.

## Deriving AI Tools

Vovk.ts can derive AI tools from back-end controllers (for same-context execution) and RPC modules (for HTTP calls), turning them into LLM function calling tools with `name`, `description`, `parameters`, and an `execute` function. This allows you to create AI agents that can interact with your back-end functionality seamlessly.

- [Realtime UI](/realtime-ui)

## OpenAPI Mixins

Vovk.ts can convert OpenAPI 3.x schema files into API modules following that follow the same calling signature as Vovk.ts RPC modules. This allows you to mix Vovk.ts back-end functionality with third-party APIs defined in OpenAPI format and create derived AI tools that combine both - your back-end and external services.

- [OpenAPI Mixins](/mixins)

## Documentation Generation and Publishing

Vovk.ts generates comprehensive documentation for RPC modules, including OpenAPI 3.1 documentation with code examples, compatible with [Scalar](https://scalar.com/), but also includes codegen templates for README and package files. This allows you to publish client libraries for TypeScript (using easily configured bundler), Python, and Rust with minimal effort.

## Vocabulary

- **API Module** - Generated module from a Vovk.ts controller or OpenAPI schema that exposes methods for making HTTP requests to the back-end.
- **RPC Module** - Generated module from a Vovk.ts controller, a subset term of API module that infer types directly from the controller methods.
- **Controller** - A class in Vovk.ts that defines HTTP endpoints using decorators. All methods in a controller are considered procedures and defined with `static` keyword.
- **Procedure** - A static method in a controller that handles HTTP requests. Procedure accepts `NextRequest` object and URL parameters and can be wrapped by [procedure](/procedure) function for additional features like validation with automatic type inference.
- **Segment** - A part of the back-end defined by a Next.js Optional Catch-All Segment that initializes controllers and is compiled into a separate serverless function.
- **OpenAPI mixin** - An API module generated from an OpenAPI 3.x schema file that can be used alongside Vovk.ts RPC modules.
