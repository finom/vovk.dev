# HTTPS in development

[Progressive Web Apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/What_is_a_progressive_web_app) require HTTPS protocol to be used both in development and production. In order to enable HTTPS in development you can use `--experimental-https` flag with `next dev` command and enable HTTPS mode in [Vovk Dev Watcher](/cli/dev) by setting `devHttps` at [config](/config) to `true` or providing `VOVK_DEV_HTTPS=true` environment variable.

```js filename="/vovk.config.mjs"
const config = {
  // ...
  devHttps: true,
};

export default config;
```

If you don't want to set the HTTPS mode globally, you can simply create another NPM script that includes the environment variable and the flag:

```json filename="/package.json"
"scripts": {
    "dev-https": "VOVK_DEV_HTTPS=true vovk dev --next-dev -- --experimental-https",
    "dev": "vovk dev --next-dev",
}
```
