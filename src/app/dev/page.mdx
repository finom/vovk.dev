# vovk dev

```sh filename="Quick CLI Ref"
$ npx vovk@draft dev --help

Usage: vovk dev|d [options] [nextArgs...]

Start schema watcher (optional flag --next-dev to start it with Next.js)

Arguments:
  nextArgs              extra arguments for the implicit next dev command call

Options:
  --next-dev            start schema watcher and Next.js with automatic port allocation
  --exit                kill the processes when schema and client are generated
  --schema-out <path>   path to schema output directory (default: .vovk-schema)
  --https, --dev-https  use HTTPS for the dev server (default: false)
  -h, --help            display help for command
```

-----

The `vovk dev` command runs a watcher that monitors controllers and updates the [schema](/schema) and [client](/typescript) as needed. It does this by issuing HTTP GET requests to `/api/<segment-name>/_schema_`, where `<segment-name>` is the relevant segment. If the schema has changed, the watcher updates the JSON files and regenerates the client modules.

## How It Works

1. `vovk dev` and `next dev` run together via [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently).
2. `vovk dev` watches the **/src/modules** directory (configurable with [`modulesDir`](/config#modulesdir)).
3. On change, the script checks whether the file contains a [controller](/controller) and belongs to a [segment](/segment) using simple RegExp checks.
4. If it is a controller within a segment, the script requests `/api/<segment-name>/_schema_` to retrieve the updated schema.
5. If the schema differs:
   - If the controller list has changed (added, removed, renamed) or method definitions (including validation) were updated, the script writes the schema to the [.vovk-schema](/config#schemaoutdir) directory as `<segment-name>.json`.
   - If the controller list changed, the client is also regenerated. The client imports schema JSON files to initialize the exported library. By default, the [composed client](/composed) is generated in `node_modules/.vovk-client` and re-exported by [vovk-client](/packages#vovk-client). When the [segmented client](/segmented) is enabled, files are generated to the source directory (default: `./src/client`).

Because `vovk dev` is typically used alongside the Next.js dev server, there are two ways to run it, both using [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently):

1. **Explicit way**: Preferable if you want minimal abstraction. The downside is that you must set `PORT` explicitly:

```sh
PORT=3000 npx concurrently 'vovk dev' 'next dev' --kill-others
```

You can pass Next.js flags as usual:

```sh
PORT=3000 npx concurrently 'vovk dev --https' 'next dev --experimental-https --turbo' --kill-others
```

2. **Implicit way**: Ports are assigned automatically. The script checks whether port 3000 (by default) is in use and selects the next available port:

```sh
npx vovk dev --next-dev
```

To pass flags to `next dev`, append them after `--`:

```sh
npx vovk dev --https --next-dev -- --experimental-https --turbo
```

Internally, the implicit mode uses the concurrently API, making both approaches nearly identical.

When you run [vovk init](/init), the `dev` script in `package.json` is updated while preserving your previous value and flags:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // was
    // "dev": "next dev --experimental-https --turbo",
    // becomes
    "dev": "vovk dev --next-dev -- --experimental-https --turbo"
  }
}
```

## Run and Exit

Use the `--exit` flag to terminate the processes started by `vovk dev` after the schema and client are generated. This is useful for one-off runs without keeping the watcher active.

```sh
npx vovk dev --next-dev --exit
```

For convenience, add a dedicated script in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "dev-exit": "vovk dev --next-dev --exit",
    // or
    "dev-exit": "PORT=3000 concurrently 'vovk dev --exit' 'next dev' --kill-others"
  }
}
```
