# vovk dev

```sh filename="Quick CLI Ref"
$ npx vovk@draft dev --help

Usage: vovk dev|d [options] [nextArgs...]

Start schema watcher (optional flag --next-dev to start it with Next.js)

Arguments:
  nextArgs              extra arguments for the implicit next dev command call

Options:
  --next-dev            start schema watcher and Next.js with automatic port allocation
  --exit                kill the processes when schema and client are generated
  --schema-out <path>   path to schema output directory (default: .vovk-schema)
  --https, --dev-https  use HTTPS for the dev server (default: false)
  -h, --help            display help for command
```

-----

The `vovk dev` command runs a script that watches for changes in controllers and updates the [schema](/schema) and the [client](/typescript) accordingly when needed by making HTTP GET requests to `/api/<segment-name>/_schema_`, where `<segment-name>` is the name of the affected segment. If the schema changes, the watcher updates the JSON files and the client modules.

## How It Works

1. `vovk dev` and `next dev` are run together with [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently).
2. `vovk dev` watches for changes in the **/src/modules** folder (can be configured with the [`modulesDir`](/config#modulesdir) config option).
3. When a change is detected, the script checks if the file contains a [controller](/controller) and if it belongs to a [segment](/segment) by performing some simple RegExp checks.
4. If the file is a controller and belongs to a segment, the script sends a GET request to `/api/<segment-name>/_schema_` to retrieve the updated schema.
5. The script checks if the schema has changed, and if so:
   - If the list of controllers has changed (added, removed, renamed) or method definitions (including validation) have changed, the script updates the schema by saving it to the [.vovk-schema](/config#schemaoutdir) folder as a `<segment-name>.json` file.
   - If the list of controllers has changed (added, removed, renamed), the script also updates the client. The client imports the schema JSON files to initialize the exported library properly. By default, the [composed client](/composed) is generated in the `node_modules/.vovk-client` folder and is re-exported by the [vovk-client](/packages#vovk-client) package. When the [segmented client](/segmented) is used, it generates files to the source folder, which by default is set to `./src/client`.

Since the `vovk dev` command is expected to be run together with the Next.js dev server, it can be run in two ways, both involving [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently):

1. **Explicit way**: This approach might be preferable for those who want less abstraction. The downside of this option is that you need to define the `PORT` variable explicitly:

```sh
PORT=3000 npx concurrently 'vovk dev' 'next dev' --kill-others
```

In this case, `next dev` flags can be defined as expected:

```sh
PORT=3000 npx concurrently 'vovk dev --https' 'next dev --experimental-https --turbo' --kill-others
```

2. **Implicit way**: In this case, the port is assigned automatically. It checks if a port (3000 by default) is already in use and attempts to find the next available one:

```sh
npx vovk dev --next-dev
```

To define additional flags for `next dev`, you can pass them after `--`:

```sh
npx vovk dev --https --next-dev -- --experimental-https --turbo
```

Behind the scenes, the implicit way uses the concurrently API, making both approaches nearly identical.

When [vovk init](/init) is used, the `dev` script is modified in the `package.json` file while preserving the previous value and flags.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // was
    // "dev": "next dev --experimental-https --turbo",
    // becomes
    "dev": "vovk dev --next-dev -- --experimental-https --turbo"
  }
}
```

## Run and Exit

The `--exit` flag can be used to kill the process created by `vovk dev` after the schema and the client have been generated. This is useful when you want to run the script once without keeping it running.

```sh
npx vovk dev --next-dev --exit
```

You can create a separate script in `package.json` for this purpose:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "dev-exit": "vovk dev --next-dev --exit",
    // or
    "dev-exit": "PORT=3000 concurrently 'vovk dev --exit' 'next dev' --kill-others"
  }
}
```
