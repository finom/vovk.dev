# Shared service

Shared service is a static class that is used to store common functions that are used in any environment (main thread, Web Worker, controller). It's a way to avoid code duplication and keep the codebase clean. The methods of a shared service should not have any global side effects and should be implemented _mostly_ pure functions (meaning that you still can modify class properties or use scoped variables).

```ts filename="/src/modules/user/UserSharedService.ts"
import type { User } from '../../types';

export default class UserSharedService {
  static getUserFullName(user: User) {
    return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

Shared service contains utilities that are used in multiple places and they're easily convertable to Web Worker procedures by applying `@worker()` class decorator. See [WPC](/worker) article for more information.
