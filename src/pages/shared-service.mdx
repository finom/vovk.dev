# Shared Service

  This article mostly a recomendation than a requirement. It's not a part of the Vovk.ts framework but a way to structure the code in a more elegant way by author's opinion.

Shared Service is a static class that is used to store common functions that are used in any environment (main thread, Web Worker, controller). It's a way to avoid code duplication and keep the codebase clean. The methods of the Shared Service should not have any global side effects and should be implemented *mostly* pure functions (meaning that you still can modify class properties or use scoped variables).

```ts filename="/src/modules/user/UserSharedService.ts"
export default class UserSharedService {
    static getUserFullName(user: User) {
        return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`;
    }
}
```

Shared service contains utilities that are used in multiple places and they're easily convertable to Web Worker procedures by applying `@worker()` class decorator. See [WPC](/worker) article for more information.
