# RPC Library

TODO: _vovkarr 

`initVovk` performs required actions to generate client-side library and no additional action from your side is required (but you probably would need to restart TS Server to update types if you use VSCode when a new controller is added).

Name of an RPC library is defined by the key in the `controllers` object. The key is used to import the library in the client code.

```ts filename="/src/app/api/[[...vovk]]/route.ts"
// ...
const controllers = { 
    UserRPC: UserController 
};
// ...
initVovk({ controllers });
```

The client library implements same-named methods but changes the method signature so you can pass required input data as options (`body`, `query` and `params`). **vovk-client** can be used in client components, server components, application state and even be distributed as a standalone package. For an illustration [vovk-examples](https://github.com/finom/vovk-examples) is published as a [standalone NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vovk-examples) to be used on [vovk.dev](https://vovk.dev) that, by itself, is a static website powered by gh-pages.

Everything exported from **vovk-client** is plain old JavaScript with typings that calls the regular `fetch` function.

```ts
import { UserRPC } from 'vovk-client';

// ...

const updatedUser = await UserRPC.updateUser({
    body: { firstName, lastName },
    query: { role: 'admin' },
    params: { id },
});

// same as
fetch(`/api/users/${id}?role=admin`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: JSON.stringify({ firstName, lastName }),
});
```

The naming convention isn't strict and can be changed to fit the application's needs. For example `UserRPC` can be renamed to `users` or any other appropriate name.

```ts filename="/src/app/api/[[...vovk]]/route.ts"
// ...
const controllers = { 
    users: UserController 
};
// ...
```

The client import may look like this:

```ts
import * as api from 'vovk-client';

await api.users.updateUser({
    // ...
});
```

The generated client library [can be customised](/customization) in order to follow custom logic required by the application.

```ts
 await UserRPC.updateUser({
    // ...
    successMessage: 'Successfully created the user',
    someOtherCustomFlag: true,
});
```

## Behind the scenes

The client library is generated at **node_modules/.vovk-client** and re-exported from **vovk-client** package. The folder contains 3 files:

- **index.ts** - uncompiled TypeScript file. Used rarely but useful if code is generated to the root of the project. See [vovk-examples](https://github.com/finom/vovk-examples).
- **client.js** - compiled JavaScript file. Used by the client.
- **client.d.ts** - TypeScript definitions. Used by the client.
