# WPC Class (Worker Procedure Call)

The standard Web Workers are awesome but they require to write additional logic by using `onmessage` handler on both sides (main thread and the Woker thread) and exchange data using `postMessage`. Vovk.ts applies the same principle that is used at controllers and builds main-thread client-side library using the auto-generated **.vovk.json**. It uses built-in browser API aush as `addEventListener` and `postMessage` and does not utilise `eval` function or `Function` constructor.

WPC Class is created from an [Isomorphic Service Class](/framework) by applying `@worker()` class decorator that defines `onmessage` handler in the Web Worker scope. 

> Quick explanation: Isomorphic Service Class is a static class that provides code that is shared between front-end and back-end. It should implement static methods as [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) that don't have access to neither application state nor server-side capabilities such as access to the database.

```ts filename="/src/modules/hello/HelloWorker.ts"
import { worker } from 'vovk';

@worker()
export default class HelloWorker {
    static heavyCalculation(iterations: number) {
        let result: number;
        // ... heavy calculations

        return result;
    }
}
```

In a non-worker scope `@worker()` does nothing. You can import the class safely in other modules, including back-end code where it's going to be behave as a normal collection of pure functions. 

To compile the worker interface, you need to pass them to `initVovk` as `workers` object option and export the type of this object as `Workers`.


```ts filename="/src/app/api/[[...vovk]]/route.ts"
import { initVovk } from 'vovk';
import HelloController from '../../../hello/HelloController';
import HelloWorker from '../../../hello/HelloWorker';
import ByeWorker from '../../../bye/ByeWorker';

const controllers = { HelloController };
const workers = { HelloWorker, ByeWorker };

export type Controllers = typeof controllers;
export type Workers = typeof workers;

export const { GET, POST, PUT, DELETE } = initVovk({ controllers, workers });
```


Once this is done, **vovk-client** is going to export the worker library that provides interface to invoke heavy calculations but doesn't initialise the Web Worker itself. To initialise the Web Worker at the main-thread interface it needs to be instantiated normally and passed as an argument of `employ` static method.

```ts
import { HelloWorker } from 'vovk-client';

HelloWorker.employ(new Worker(new URL('./path/to/HelloWorker.ts', import.meta.url)));
```

This bulky syntax is required to invoke the Webpack 5+ loader used by Next.js internally. After it's done the static methods of the mapped class type return `Promise` to delegate heavy calculations to the parallel thread.

```ts
const result = await HelloWorker.heavyCalculation(1e9);
```

Note that `Worker` class does not exist in Next.js SSR environment and in case if the code is exposed to non-client-side environment (for example outside of `useEffect`) it's recommended to check if `Worker` exists at the global scope.

```ts
import { HelloWorker } from 'vovk-client';

if(typeof Worker !== 'undefined') {
    HelloWorker.employ(new Worker(new URL('./path/to/HelloWorker.ts', import.meta.url)));
}
```

`employ` method returns the worker interface itself so as a nicer solution you can use ternary operator to make the Worker library to be nullish.

```ts
import { HelloWorker } from 'vovk-client';

const MyWorker = typeof Worker === 'undefined' 
    ? null 
    : HelloWorker.employ(new Worker(new URL('./path/to/HelloWorker.ts', import.meta.url)));

await MyWorker?.heavyCalculation(1e9);
```

## Worker termination

A worker can be terminated with built-in `terminate` method.

```ts
HelloWorker.terminate();
```

## Async generators

WPC classes support generators and async generators to implement continious event streaming. 

```ts filename="/src/modules/hello/HelloWorker.ts"
import { worker } from 'vovk';

@worker()
export default class HelloWorker {
    static *generator() {
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            yield i;
        }
    }

    static async *asyncGenerator() {
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
            yield i;
        }
    }
}
```

Vovk.ts turns them both into async generators when they're imported from **vovk-client**.

```ts
import { HelloWorker } from 'vovk-client';

// ... plug in the Web Worker with "use" method ...

for await (const number of HelloWorker.generator()) {
    console.log(number); // 0 ... 9
}

for await (const number of HelloWorker.asyncGenerator()) {
    console.log(number); // 0 ... 9
}
```

## Making HTTP requests inside a WPC Class

Since Web Workers are run in a browser (but just in another thread) it's capable to fetch server-side data as expected.

```ts filename="/src/modules/hello/HelloController.ts"
import { get } from 'vovk';

export class HelloController {
    @get.auto()
    static getIterations() {
        return { iterations: 100_000_000 };
    }
}
```

```ts filename="/src/modules/hello/HelloWorker.ts"
import { HelloController } from 'vovk-client';

@worker()
export default class HelloWorker {
    static async heavyCalculation() {
        const { iterations } = await HelloController.getIterations();
        let result: number;

        // ...

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Using WPC Class inside another WPC Class

Workers can use other workers. The syntax remains the same and you don't need to check for `Worker` variable to exist.

```ts
import { AnotherWorker } from 'vovk-client';

AnotherWorker.employ(new Worker(new URL('./path/to/AnotherWorker.ts', import.meta.url)));

export default class HelloWorker {
    heavyCalculation() {
        const anotherWorkerResult = await AnotherWorker.doSomethingHeavy();
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Forking the Worker

To fork the worker and create as many parallel processes as needed you can use `fork` method instead of `employ`.

```ts
import { HelloWorker } from 'vovk-client';

function getFork() {
    return HelloWorker.fork(new Worker(new URL('./path/to/HelloWorker.ts', import.meta.url)));
}

const HelloWorker1 = getFork();
const HelloWorker2 = getFork();
const HelloWorker3 = getFork();

const [result1, result2, result3] = await Promise.all([
    HelloWorker1.heavyCalculation(),
    HelloWorker2.heavyCalculation(),
    HelloWorker3.heavyCalculation(),
]);
```
