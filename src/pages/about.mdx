## The Author

Being an Upwork freelancer for many years, competing with developers from all
over the world, I have to increase my effeciency and quality of my code to stay
competitive by learning new technologies and frameworks constantly, and having to always be
able to deliver the best possible solution for my clients to stay on this highly agressive market.

Having over 70 projects completed and thousands of mistakes made, being quite highly paid developer on this market, every time I have to ask myself or bring these questions to teams I work with:

- How to deliver solutions as fast as possible?
- What is the best way to structure the project code?
- How to build an extensible architecture that's going to be relevant for years?
- What libraries are popular today?
- How can I make my code more readable?
- How to deploy faster and decrease chances of deployment problems at the most unexpected moment?
- Most importantly, how to not fuck up the entire project after many months of work?

Sure, it sounds challanging but believe me or not I'm having a lot of fun! Being at this rapidly changing environment is like a videogame for me. 

That's why I came into conclusion that I need to build something that would serve me as a great tool to keep doing my work faster but also keep its quality as high as possible, not depending on if I'm sleepy or I've skipped my workout day.

## The Project

Vovk.ts combines several approaches borrowed from other libraries and framework with a pinch of creativity.

- What's the main and the most powerful framework today? Next.js.
- What's the easiest and robust way to deploy Next.js? Vercel (they're not sponsors yet).
- What's the most effecient way to invoke server-side code? tRPC or similar? Here you go.
- What's the best structure for the app? NestJS providing Controller-Service-Repository pattern? Give me two!
- Edge runtime that allows to deliver back-end geographically closer to users? Yes!
- Good old REST instead of some custom protocols? Sure!
- Text streaming for AI apps? No problem.
- TypeScript? Always!

The project covers all the requirements I've ever had in my practice into one elegant solution, being a tiny add-on over Next.js API.
Having less than 1600 lines of code, it's a perfect tool for building full-stack applications with the highest code quality and the fastest results.

Enjoy! You definitely will!
