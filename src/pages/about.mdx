## The Author

As an experienced Upwork freelancer, I've competed with developers globally for many years.
To remain competitive in this dynamic and highly aggressive market, 
I continuously improve my coding efficiency and quality. 
I am committed to mastering new technologies and frameworks, 
ensuring that I always deliver the best possible solutions for my clients.

With over 70 projects completed and countless lessons learned, and consistently earning above the market average, I frequently engage in critical reflection and discussions with my teams:

- How can we deliver solutions more rapidly?
- What is the optimal structure for the project code?
- How can we develop an architecture that remains relevant and extensible for years to come, even if I leave?
- Which libraries and approaches are currently popular?
- How can we enhance the readability of my code?
- What are the best practices for deploying swiftly while minimizing the risk of deployment issues at critical times?
- Most crucially, how to not fuck up the entire project after many months of effort?

This led me to the realization that I need to create a tool that not only enhances the speed of my work but also ensures consistently high quality, that is not depending on if I'm sleepy or if skip my workout today.

## The Project

Vovk.ts combines several approaches borrowed from other projects with a pinch of creativity.

- The most powerful framework today? Next.js.
- The simplest and most robust deployment method for Next.js? Vercel (though they aren't sponsors yet).
- The most efficient way to invoke server-side code from the client-side? tRPC or something similar? Check.
- The optimal structure for the app? NestJS, with decorators and Controller-Service-Repository pattern? Double check.
- Need an edge runtime that delivers backend services geographically closer to users? Included.
- Prefer the reliability of good old REST over custom protocols? Absolutely.
- Text streaming capabilities for AI applications? Seamless.
- TypeScript for safer and cleaner code? Always.

Vovk.ts encapsulates all the lessons from my extensive experience into one elegant solution, 
serving as a streamlined add-on to the Next.js API. With less than 1600 lines of code, 
it’s the perfect tool for developing full-stack applications that prioritize both speed and quality.

Enjoy! I'm confident you will.


### Features

- 👵 **REST API:** Utilize the good old REST without the need for custom protocols.
- 🪄 **RPC Capabilities**: No need to choose between REST and RPC anymore — use both.
- 🚢 **Simplified Architecture:** Run your full-stack Next.js application on a single port, avoiding the complexities of a monorepo.
