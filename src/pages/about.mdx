## The Author

As an experienced Upwork freelancer, I've competed with developers globally for many years.
To remain competitive in this dynamic and highly aggressive market, 
I continuously improve my coding efficiency and quality. 
I am committed to mastering new technologies and frameworks, 
ensuring that I always deliver the best possible solutions for my clients.

With over 70 projects completed and countless lessons learned, and consistently earning above the market average, I frequently engage in critical reflection and discussions with my teams:

- How can we deliver solutions more rapidly?
- What is the optimal structure for the project code?
- How can we develop an architecture that remains relevant and extensible for years to come, even if I leave?
- Which libraries and approaches are currently popular?
- How can we enhance the readability of my code?
- What are the best practices for deploying swiftly while minimizing the risk of deployment issues at critical times?
- Most crucially, how to not fuck up the entire project after many months of effort?

This led me to the realization that I need to create a tool that not only enhances the speed of my work but also ensures consistently high quality, that is not depending on if I'm sleepy or if skip my workout today.

## The Project

Vovk.ts combines several approaches borrowed from other projects with a pinch of creativity.

- The most powerful framework today? Next.js.
- The simplest and most robust deployment method for Next.js? Vercel (though they aren't sponsors yet).
- The most efficient way to invoke server-side code from the client-side? tRPC or something similar? Check.
- The optimal structure for the app? NestJS, with decorators and Controller-Service-Repository pattern? Double check.
- Need an edge runtime that delivers backend services geographically closer to users? Included.
- Prefer the reliability of good old REST over custom protocols? Absolutely.
- Text streaming capabilities for AI applications? Seamless.
- TypeScript for safer and cleaner code? Always.

Vovk.ts encapsulates all the lessons from my extensive experience into one elegant solution, 
serving as a streamlined add-on to the Next.js API. With less than 1600 lines of code, 
it‚Äôs the perfect tool for developing full-stack applications that prioritize both speed and quality.

Enjoy! I'm confident you will.


### Features

- üëµ **REST API:** Utilize the good old REST without the need for custom protocols.
- ü™Ñ **RPC Capabilities**: No need to choose between REST and RPC anymore ‚Äî use both.
- üö¢ **Simplified Architecture:** Run your full-stack Next.js application on a single port, avoiding the complexities of a monorepo.
- üßê **Optimized Code Quality:** Implement the Service-Controller-Repository pattern for peak code efficiency.
- üöÑ **Edge Runtime Support:** Access edge computing capabilities straight out of the box.
- üåø **Lightweight:** Streamlined for efficiency and speed.
- ü§è **Compact Client Code:** Generates minimal code, essentially a neat wrapper over the `fetch` function.
- üì¶ **Effortless Distribution:** Easily bundle and distribute your client API library using Webpack, Rollup, or any other bundler.
- ü§ù **Seamless Integration with Next.js App Router:** Works perfectly with standard Next.js APIs like `Response`, `headers`, and `redirect`.
- üß† **User-Friendly:** Designed for easy learning and adoption.
- üì± **Broad Compatibility:** Integrates effortlessly with React Native and other JavaScript environments.
- ü§ñ **Text Streaming:** Supports streaming for Large Language Model applications using disposable async generators.
- üìÑ **Static API Generation:** Leverage [generateStaticAPI](./api-reference#generatestaticapi) to deploy your static JSON API.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Web Worker Support:** Enhance browser performance with multi-threading capabilities.
- üèéÔ∏è **High Performance:** Delivers rapid execution both client-side and server-side.
- üîß **Fully Customizable:** Tailor to meet specific project requirements.

## Glossary

- **Service-Controller-Repository** pattern: A design pattern that separates the business logic (Service), request handling (Controller), and data access (Repository) into distinct layers.
- **REST**: Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for designing networked applications. A REST API uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations. Learn more about REST [here](https://restfulapi.net/).
- **RPC**: Remote Procedure Call, an approach that allows a client application to invoke server-side functions. Find out more about RPC [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call).
- **WPC**: Worker Procedure Call, an approach that enables a front-end application to call functions running in a Web Worker. First introduced in Vovk.ts. Read more about Web Workers [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).
- **Edge Computing**: A distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed. 
More details can be found [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing).
- **Static Class**: A class that cannot be instantiated and is used to group related methods and properties. JavaScript/TypeScript does not have a built-in `static` keyword for classes, but it is a common pattern in other languages like Java and C#. Instead, TypeScript uses the `static` keyword to define static methods and properties on a regular class.
- **Disposable Object**: An object that is used once and then discarded. In TypeScript, a disposable object is created with `using` or `await using` (instead of `let` or `const`) and is automatically disposed of after the code block has ended by calling a method under `Symbol.dispose` or `Symbol.asyncDispose` key. 
For more information, see [TypeScript 5.2 Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-5-2.html).
- **Async Generator**: A function that returns an AsyncIterable object.
- **Async Iterable**: An object that can be used in a `for await...of` loop. It is similar to an Iterable, but the `Symbol.asyncIterator` method returns an AsyncIterator object. Learn more about async iterables [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of).
