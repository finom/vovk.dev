Being an Upwork freelancer for many years, competing with developers from all
over the world, I have to increase my effeciency and quality of my code to stay
competitive. I have to learn new technologies and frameworks, and I have to be
able to deliver the best possible solution for my clients.

Having over 70 projects completed, being quite highly paid developer, every time I have to ask myself or bring these questions to teams I work with:

- How to deliver solutions as fast as possible?
- What is the best way to structure my code?
- How to build extensible architecture?
- What libraries are popular today?
- How can I make my code more readable?
- How to deploy faster and decreas chances of deployment problems, the most ugly and most unexpected situation in practce?
- Most importantly: how to not fuck up the project after being pushed to do things faster for many months?

Sure, it sounds challanging but believe me or not I'm having a lot of fun! Being at this rapid boiling environment is like a videogame for me. 

That's why I came into conclusion that I need to build something that would serve me as a great tool to keep going.

## The Project

- What's the main and the most powerful framework today? Next.js.
- What's the easiest way to deploy Next.js? Vercel (they're not sponsors yet).
- What's the most effecient way to invoke server-side procedures? tRPC or similar? Here you go.
- What's the best structure for the app? NestJS providing Controller-Service-Repository? Give me two!
- Edge runtime that allows to deliver back-end geographically closer to users? Yes!
- REST instead of some custom tricky protocols? Sure!
- Streaming AI responses? No problem.
- TypeScript? Typescript!

Vovk.ts combines all the requirements I've ever had in my practice into one elegant solution, being a tiny add-on over Next.js API.
Having less than 1600 lines of code, it's a perfect tool for building full-stack applications with the highest code quality and the fastest possible speed and very easy deployment.

Enjoy! You definitely will!

## Features
