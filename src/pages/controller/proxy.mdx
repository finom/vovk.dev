# Proxy Endpoints

You can easily create a proxy endpoint by fetching data from another server with `fetch` function. 

```ts
import { get } from 'vovk';
export default class ProxyController {
    @get('proxy')
    static proxy() {
        return fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    }
}
```

Since the `fetch` function returns a promise of `Response` object, the [client](/client) will automatically resolve it's type as `Response` so you can use any of its methods in a type-safe manner. The following example is borrowed at a real project where we fetch a PDF file and use it's Blob with [pdfjs-dist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdfjs-dist).

```ts
import { ProxyRPC } from 'vovk-client';

// ...
const response = await ProxyRPC.proxy();
const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
const blob = new Blob([arrayBuffer], { type: 'application/pdf' });
// ...
```
