# Client Library

`initVovk` performs required actions to generate client-side library and no additional action from your side is required (but you probably would need to restart TS Server to update types if you use VSCode when a new controller is added).

The client library implements the same methods (in our case `updateUser`) but changes the method interface so you can pass required input data as options (`body`, `query` and `params`). **vovk-client** can be used in client components, server components, application state and even be distributed as a standalone package. For an illustration [vovk-examples](https://github.com/finom/vovk-examples) is published as a [standalone NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vovk-examples) to be used on [vovk.dev](https://vovk.dev) that, by itself, is a static website powered by gh-pages.

Everything exported from **vovk-client** is plain old JavaScript with typings that calls the regular `fetch` function.

```ts
import { UserController } from 'vovk-client';

// ...

const updatedUser = await UserController.updateUser({
    body: { firstName, lastName },
    query: { role: 'admin' },
    params: { id: '69' },
});

// same as
fetch('/api/users/69?role=admin', {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: JSON.stringify({ firstName, lastName }),
});
```

It's worthy to mention that client library [can be customised](/customization) in order to follow custom logic required by the application.

```ts
 await UserController.updateUser({
    // ...
    successMessage: 'Successfully created the user',
    someOtherCustomFlag: true,
});
```
