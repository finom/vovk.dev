# Errors: `HttpException` class and `HttpStatus` enum

You can gracefully throw HTTP exceptions that is similarl to NestJS. `HttpException` class accepts 2 arguments. The first one is an HTTP code that can be retrieved from `HttpStatus`, the other one is an error text.

```ts
import { HttpException, HttpStatus } from 'vovk';

// ...
static async updateUser(/* ... */) {
    // ...
    throw new HttpException(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, 'Something went wrong');
}
```

The errors are re-thrown at the client library with the same interface.

```ts
import { UserController } from 'vovk-client';
import { HttpException } from 'vovk';

// ...
try {
    const updatedUser = await UserController.updateUser(/* ... */);
} catch(e) {
    console.log(e instanceof HttpException); // true
    const err = e as HttpException;
    console.log(err.message, err.statusCode);
}

```

Regular errors such as `Error` are equivalent to `HttpException` with code `500`.

```ts
import { HttpException, HttpStatus } from 'vovk';

// ...
static async updateUser(/* ... */) {
    // ...
    throw new Error('Something went wrong'); // 500
}
```

You can also throw custom objects that are going to be re-thrown on the client-side as is.

```ts
throw { hello: 'World' };
```
