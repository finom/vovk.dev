# CLI

Vovk provides a set of commands to simplify the development process. The commands are available via `vovk` binary that is installed with **vovk-cli** package.

- [vovk init](/cli/vovk-init) - creates a new Vovk.ts project.
- [vovk dev](/cli/vovk-dev) - runs Vovk Dev Watcher that watches for changes at controllers and workers and updates the [schema](/schema) and the [client](/client) accordingly when needed.
- [vovk generate](/cli/vovk-generate) - generates the client based on the schema and creates **.js** and **.d.ts** files at **node_modules/.vovk-client** that are re-exported by **vovk-client**. Can be used to generate the client for other programming languages.
- [vovk new](/cli/vovk-new) - module generator that helps to create segments, controllers, services, workers and other modules that you can define as a template at [config](/config).
