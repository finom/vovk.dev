You’re improving the documentation for the Vovk.ts framework. Your job is to make the text sound smoother and more professional while keeping the original intent and structure.

Please:

Improve phrasing, grammar, and punctuation so it reads clearly and naturally.

You can slightly improve the content when it helps make the explanation clearer or more polished, but don’t change the meaning or remove important details.
